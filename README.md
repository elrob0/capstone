My goal is to host Hydra as a web applictation 
This web app will allow one to use the password cracking tool in a web browser
Once the password cracking tool can be used successfully the ability to use anonmiziotation tools such as TOR nd proxy lists can also be used.
A large  password wordlist must also be used in the web app to look up passwords.
The goal would be to use the web app online to attack passwords in accounts for legal pentration tests and for white hat activity.
This would also be helpful to upload to a phone application allowing a pen tester to use the tool on their mobile device.  Enabling them to attack weak passwords when they might be working and notice that they may need the ability to attack passwords without loading up any operatig system just standalone by itself.
